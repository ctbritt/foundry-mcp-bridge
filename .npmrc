# Audit configuration
# Note: The reported vulnerabilities are in @league-of-foundry-developers/foundry-vtt-types
# dev dependencies (TinyMCE, Socket.IO types). Since this is a TypeScript types-only
# package, these vulnerabilities do not affect runtime - they're only used during compilation.
# Upgrading to v13 types would require significant code refactoring to match Foundry v13 API.
